# Loot Drop

Provides an interface that allows you to select from a valid loot table entry. You can then shift-right-click an existing vanilla chest, or press a keybind to create one in front of you, which will be tuned to that.

Shift-right-clicking an existing chest or using the keybind in front of an existing chest will replace its contents.

This mod is purely for testing purposes.
